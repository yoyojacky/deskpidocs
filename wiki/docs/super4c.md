### Main Power Input 

The main power input uses a barrel power connector (inner diameter 2mm, outer diameter 6.6mm) with a voltage range of DC 12V-20V. 
Two sockets(DC1, DC2) support redundant power input. 
When two power supplies with different voltages are inserted simultaneously, the hardware will automatically select the power supply with the higher voltage.

![super4c02](./imgs/super4c/main_02.png) 

### Main Power Protection

The main power supply passes through protection circuits, voltage and current sampling circuits, reverse polarity protection, and fuse circuits before powering the internal components and outputting to the J15 connector for external main fan power supply. 

> Note: When connecting a fan, ensure that the fan's rated voltage matches the main power supply voltage.


### Internal 5V DC/DC and Buttons 

The main power supply passes through four-channel DC/DC circuits to convert to 5V power, supplying each CM5 and its peripherals. 
Each DC/DC channel has an independent power reset button (PWR_OFF1/2/3/4). 
Pressing the button (SW3/4/5/6) will reset the power of each CM5 and its peripheral channel.

![super4c03](./imgs/super4c/main_03.png) 

### Voltage and Current Monitoring 

Both the main power sockets and the four internal 5V power rails are equipped with voltage and current sensing capabilities. 
Through the I2C interface of the ESP32, two INA3221 chips (covering a total of six channels) are controlled to monitor voltage and current.

#### ESP32 Buttons

* **BOOT (SW1):**
  - When the BOOT button is held down while powering on the motherboard (or while powered on, hold both BOOT and EN buttons, release the EN button first, and then release the BOOT button), the ESP32 will enter programming mode. The ESP32 can then be programmed via the UART interface (J47).
  - In the default firmware, after the ESP32 starts up, the BOOT pin is used as an input IO (GPIO0). When the BOOT button is pressed for more than 1 second and then released, the ESP32 will sequentially disable the PMIC_ENABLE signals for the four CM5 modules and the ENABLE signals for the four DC/DC (5V) channels, with an interval of approximately 0.5 seconds.

* **EN (SW2):**
  - In the default firmware, pressing the EN button will reset all CM5_PMIC_ENABLE and DC/DC (5V) ENABLE signals.

#### ESP32 I2C Address

The I2C signals of the ESP32 are connected to both the J12 and J6 headers, as well as the two onboard INA3221 chips. The headers can be used to expand external I2C devices.

| **Item**        | **Channels / Pins / Address**                        | **Description** |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **J12 Connector** | 4-pin 2.54 mm header (GND, 3V3, SDA, SCL)            | Header for plugging in an **OLED module** (I²C interface) |
| **J16 Connector** | 4-pin 2.54 mm header (GND, 3V3, SDA, SCL)            | Header for **additional I²C devices** |
| **INA3221 #1**    | 3-channel • 20 mΩ shunt • I²C address `0x40`         | IN1 → **DC1**<br>IN2 → **DC2**<br>IN3 → **DC/DC 5 V #1** |
| **INA3221 #2**    | 3-channel • 20 mΩ shunt • I²C address `0x41`         | IN1 → **DC/DC 5 V #2**<br>IN2 → **DC/DC 5 V #3**<br>IN3 → **DC/DC 5 V #4** |

The pinout diagram for J12/J6 connectors is as follows:

Click the green `Save & Reboot` button to save the configuration to the Super4C motherboard.

![webpage3](./imgs/super4c/webpage3.png)

The motherboard will automatically reboot. Wait for approximately 10 seconds.

![webpage4](./imgs/super4c/webpage4.png)

After rebooting, connect your computer to the same local network as the Super4C. 
Then, enter the IP address displayed on the OLED screen (e.g., "192.168.1.49") in a web browser and press "Enter". 
From this point, users can remotely control the power of the Super4C, monitor current, and perform other operations within the local network.

![webpage5](./imgs/super4c/webpage5.png)

#### Web Controller Power Switch Button Operations

* The page has eight independent power switch buttons, including `PSU #1~4` and `CM5 #1~4`.
* The PSUs are the 5V power units on the board, with a total of four. 
* Each PSU powers the CM5, NVME, SD, USB, 2.5G network, and other circuits in each channel. Therefore, turning off a PSU will cut power to all the aforementioned circuits in that channel.
* The `CM5 #1~4` buttons control the `PMIC_ENABLE` signals of each CM5 channel. Turning off a CM5 will only cut power to that channel's CM5, while other circuits such as NVME, SD, USB, and 2.5G network will remain powered.
* To operate, click the `Switch OFF` or `Switch ON` buttons to perform the power actions.

> When powered on, the corresponding channel status displays "ON" with a colored status light.
> When powered off, the corresponding channel status displays "OFF" with a gray status light.

> Note: DC1/DC2 are external input power channels and cannot be controlled via switches. Do not confuse them.

![webpage6](./imgs/super4c/webpage6.png)

* The `Switch All OFF` button will turn off all eight switches simultaneously. <font color=red>Use with caution.</font>
* The `Switch All ON` button will turn on all eight switches simultaneously.<font color=red>Use with caution.</font>
* The `Toggle All` button will toggle all switches.<font color=red>Use with caution.</font>

![webpage7](./imgs/super4c/webpage7.png)

    
### OLED Screen Display

After connecting an SSD1306 screen:

* Displays the current WiFi mode and IP address.
* Displays the current of the six current monitoring channels on the motherboard, in units of Amps (A).

![webpage8](./imgs/super4c/webpage8.jpg)
![webpage9](./imgs/super4c/webpage9.jpg)

If the W5500 function is not enabled, but an Ethernet cable is connected, the screen will display "W55" when connected and "OFF" when disconnected.

### Diagram Block 

![Diagram Block](./imgs/super4c/diagramblock.png)

### Flash an image to a Compute Module
To flash the same image to multiple Compute Modules, use the Raspberry Pi Secure Boot Provisioner. To customise an OS image to flash onto those devices, use pi-gen.

The Compute Module has an on-board eMMC device connected to the primary SD card interface. This guide explains how to flash (write) an operating system image to the eMMC storage of a single Compute Module.
Lite variants of Compute Modules do not have on-board eMMC. Instead, follow the procedure to flash a storage device for other Raspberry Pi devices at Install an operating system.

#### Prerequisites
To flash the Compute Module eMMC, you need the following:
* Another computer, referred to in this guide as the host device. You can use Linux (we recommend Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu), Windows 11, or macOS.
*	Super4C motherboard.
*	A USB-C cable for Compute Module models flashing image. 

#### Set up the IO Board

* 1.Connect the Compute Module to the Super4C board. When connected, the Compute Module should lie flat.
* 2.Fit `nRPI_BOOT` to `GND` Pin (disable eMMC Boot) on the board with jumper.

![super4c14](./imgs/super4c/main_14.png) 

* Connect a cable from USB-C slave port J11 on the board to the host device.

![super4c15](./imgs/super4c/main_15.png) 

#### Set up the host device
Next, let’s set up software on the host device.
For a host device, we recommend a Raspberry Pi 4 or newer running 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS.

##### For Linux: 

To set up software on a Linux host device:

* 1.Run the following command to install rpiboot (or, alternatively, build rpiboot from source):

```bash 
sudo apt install rpiboot
```

* 2.Connect the IO Board to power.
* 3.Then, run rpiboot:
```bash
sudo rpiboot
```
* 4.After a few seconds, the Compute Module should appear as a mass storage device. Check the /dev/ directory, likely /dev/sda or /dev/sdb, for the device. Alternatively, run lsblk and search for a device with a storage capacity that matches the capacity of your Compute Module.

##### For macOS:

To set up software on a macOS host device:

* 1.First, build rpiboot from source.
* 2.Connect the IO Board to power.
* 3.Then, run the rpiboot executable with the following command:

```bash
rpiboot -d mass-storage-gadget64
```
* 4.When the command finishes running, you should see a message stating "The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer." Click Ignore. Your Compute Module should now appear as a mass storage device

##### For Windows:

To set up software on a Windows 11 host device:

* 1.Download the Windows installer or build rpiboot from source. 
Windows installer Download URL: https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe
Build source : https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot
* 2.Double-click on the installer to run it. This installs the drivers and boot tool. Do not close any driver installation windows which appear during the installation process.
* 3.Reboot
* 4.Connect the IO Board to power. Windows should discover the hardware and configure the required drivers.
* 5.On CM4 and later devices, select Raspberry Pi - Mass Storage Gadget - 64-bit from the start menu. After a few seconds, the Compute Module eMMC or NVMe will appear as USB mass storage devices. This also provides a debug console as a serial port gadget.
* 6.On CM3 and older devices, select rpiboot. Double-click on RPiBoot.exe to run it. After a few seconds, the Compute Module eMMC should appear as a USB mass storage device.

### Flash the eMMC 

You can use Raspberry Pi Imager to flash an operating system image to a Compute Module.  Raspberry Pi Imager Download URL: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#raspberry-pi-imager
Alternatively, use dd to write a raw OS image (such as Raspberry Pi OS) to your Compute Module. Run the following command, replacing /dev/sdX with the path to the mass storage device representation of your Compute Module and raw_os_image.img with the path to your raw OS image:

```bash
sudo dd if=raw_os_image.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4MiB
```

Once the image has been written, disconnect and reconnect the Compute Module. You should now see two partitions (for Raspberry Pi OS):
<pre>
/dev/sdX    <- Device
/dev/sdX1   <- First partition (FAT)
/dev/sdX2   <- Second partition (Linux filesystem)
</pre>

You can mount the /dev/sdX1 and /dev/sdX2 partitions normally.
For example: 
Following figure shows that how to dump the OS from Raspberry Pi’s MicroSD card to the CM5’s eMMC storage: 

![super4c16](./imgs/super4c/main_16.png) 

## Boot from eMMC 
Disconnect `nRPI_BOOT` from `GND` (disable eMMC Boot) on the super4c board jumper.

Disconnect the USB slave port. Power-cycle the super4c board to boot the Compute Module from the new image you just wrote to eMMC.

## 0. Hardware & Network Topology

| Node        | Role          | IP Address       |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 5 | **Ansible Control Node** | 192.168.10.1/24 |
| CM5-01      | Compute Module 5 | 192.168.10.11 |
| CM5-02      | Compute Module 5 | 192.168.10.12 |
| CM5-03      | Compute Module 5 | 192.168.10.13 |
| CM5-04      | Compute Module 5 | 192.168.10.14 |

---

## 1. Prepare the Control Node (ONLY this machine)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y python3-pip sshpass jq
pip3 install --user ansible-core==2.16
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

mkdir -p ~/cm5-cluster/{inventory,group_vars,playbooks,roles,report}
cd ~/cm5-cluster

```

## Inventory & First-Time SSH Setup
* Create `inventory/hosts.yml`
```yaml
all:
  children:
    cm5_cluster:
      hosts:
        CM501: {ansible_host: 192.168.10.11}
        CM502: {ansible_host: 192.168.10.12}
        CM503: {ansible_host: 192.168.10.13}
        CM504: {ansible_host: 192.168.10.14}
      vars:
        ansible_user: pi
        ansible_ssh_pass: raspberry
        ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```
Generate & push SSH key (password login is kept):

### Create playbooks/init-ssh.yml file 
```yaml
---
- hosts: cm5_cluster
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Push public key
      authorized_key:
        user: pi
        key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub') }}"
```

### Run once:
```bash 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ''
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix   # only if using FQCN
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/init-ssh.yml

* Create a file structure like this:
<pre>
cpu_temp/
├── hosts.ini          # Inventory file – list of managed hosts
├── cpu_temp.yml       # Main Ansible playbook
└── templates/
    └── temp_report.j2 # Optional Jinja2 template for formatted output
</pre>

| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cpu_temp/`                | Root directory that contains all playbook-related files.                               |
| `hosts.ini`                | Inventory file listing the managed hosts (the Raspberry Pi nodes).                     |
| `cpu_temp.yml`             | Main Ansible playbook that defines the tasks to retrieve and process CPU temperatures. |
| `templates/`               | Directory for Jinja2 templates used to create formatted reports or files.              |
| `templates/temp_report.j2` | Optional Jinja2 template for generating a nicely-formatted output report.              |


* Create `playbooks/cpu_temp.yml`
```yaml
# This playbook retrieves the CPU temperature of managed Raspberry Pi hosts.
# The `vcgencmd measure_temp` command is executed on each host to get the real-time temperature.

- name: Retrieve CPU temperature from managed Raspberry Pi hosts
  hosts: rpi
  gather_facts: no        # Skip full fact gathering to speed up execution
  become: no              # vcgencmd can be run by the pi user without sudo

  tasks:
    - name: Execute vcgencmd measure_temp to obtain real-time temperature
      ansible.builtin.command: vcgencmd measure_temp
      register: temp_raw  # Save command output in the variable temp_raw

    - name: Parse temperature value (remove prefix and unit)
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        cpu_temp: "{{ (temp_raw.stdout | regex_replace('temp=', '') | regex_replace(\"'C\\n\", '')) }}"

    - name: Display temperature for each host in the console
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Host {{ inventory_hostname }} CPU temperature: {{ cpu_temp }}°C"

    - name: Append results to a local summary file (optional)
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: "./cpu_temp_summary.txt"
        line: "{{ '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' | strftime }} - {{ inventory_hostname }} - {{ cpu_temp }}°C"
        create: yes
      delegate_to: localhost  # Run this task on the Ansible control node 
```

| `- name: Get Raspberry Pi CPU Temperature`                      | Name of the play; it appears in the playbook output.                                                            |
| `hosts: rpi`                                     | Targets only hosts in the `[rpi]` group from the inventory.                                                     |
| `gather_facts: no`                               | Skips the `setup` module to reduce SSH round-trips and speed up execution.                                      |
| `become: no`                                     | Does not escalate privileges; `vcgencmd` does not require root.                                                 |
| `ansible.builtin.command: vcgencmd measure_temp` | Executes the temperature-retrieval command on the remote host.                                                  |
| `register: temp_raw`                             | Captures stdout, stderr, and return code of the command into the variable `temp_raw`.                           |
| `set_fact: cpu_temp: ...`                        | Uses regex to strip prefixes like `temp=` and the trailing `'C`, leaving only the numeric value (e.g., `47.2`). |
| `debug: msg: "Host: ..."`                           | Prints the formatted temperature for each host in real time on the console.                                     |
| `lineinfile: ...`                                | Appends results to `cpu_temp_summary.txt` on the control node for later review or graphing.                     |
| `delegate_to: localhost`                         | Ensures the file-append task runs on the Ansible control node, not on the managed hosts.                        |

* Execute:
```bash 
cd cpu_temp
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini cpu_temp.yml
```
